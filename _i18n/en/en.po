Latin culture comes to life through music, storytelling and traditional games. With this approach the learning process becomes fun and engaging, thus making the language easier to assimilate. Her approach to teaching art is based on the idea that art is about exploration. She supports children in creating artwork that reflects their own interests, ideas, discoveries and inventions."

Latin culture comes to life through music, storytelling and traditional games. With this approach the learning process becomes fun and engaging, thus making the language easier to assimilate. Her approach to teaching art is based on the idea that art is about exploration. She supports children in creating artwork that reflects their own interests, ideas, discoveries and inventions."

Families are notified via phone and email when a space is available for their child. Parents will have 48 hours to notify us of their decision, complete the enrollment forms, and pay the deposit and fees. We will regularly assess openings available and use the wait list to inform families when availability exists."

                The teachers at Nuestro Jardín are passionate about providing the opportunity for children to learn the Spanish language in a warm, caring, safe and secure environment.  We strive to provide an active learning environment where children will learn trust, self-expression and self worth. We understand the importance of focusing on the whole child (the social, emotional, cognitive, and physical aspects) to ensure children reach their full potential. Each teacher at Nuestro Jardín brings with them many years of personal and professional experience that contribute to the climate and culture of our Spanish immersion program. We dedicate ourselves to enrich and support the experiences of our students each and every day.

<p>
    Claudia was born and raised in Santiago, Chile and has been living in the US since 1992. She received a BA degree in Linguistics with a minor in Spanish and a TESOL (teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) Certificate from San Jose State University. In Oregon, she received a Master's Degree in TESOL from Portland State University and also obtained her Oregon Teaching License.
</p>
<p>
    Claudia has been in education for 20 years, starting as a teacher in a Spanish immersion program at San Jose Unified School District in California and later as an ESL instructor at Portland State University. During her time at San Jose Unified School District, she was able to both have first-hand experience and see the benefits bilingual immersion programs can offer. As a linguist, second language teacher, and second language learner herself, Claudia has a deep understanding of first and second language acquisition and learning.
</p>
<p>
    Claudia's vision for creating a Spanish immersion preschool became a reality in 2016. In the past year, she has taken a mentoring role to support the Nuestro Jardín community and is excited to spend time in the classroom with teachers and students!  
</p>
<p>
    Claudia is the proud mother of two boys. She loves spending time outdoors with her husband, Alexei, and her children. She also has another passion: running, which keeps her focused and in balance.

                                        <p>Ann Marie Pyper was born and raised in Venezuela.</p>
<p>She studied Human Resources and got her degree in 2004. She worked in that field for many years with different
    companies that helped her build a solid experience. In 2016, due to the situation in her country, she decided to come to Portland, 
    Oregon, to look for another opportunity and to keep growing as a person. It was here where she found love. She got
    married and soon after, she started to work with children to teach them Spanish at a local preschool.</p>
<p>Anny has been at Nuestro Jardín since February 2019. This has been an adventure for Ann Marie, which has brought her
    many joyful experiences, in which she has been able to care for and give all the love she hasn't been able to give to
    her loved ones in her native country.</p>
<p>As the Assistant Director of Operations at Nuestro Jardín, she looks forward to continuing to grow professionally.
    She is excited about doing something she really loves while still being surrounded by children.</p>
<p>In her free time, she likes going dancing, attending different cultural events, traveling, and making new friends.

    profession. She graduated as a teacher in experimental education, and in 1990, she started working as a teacher, and
    all
    the while she was working towards her Bachelor's Degree in Education. Later, she obtained a Master’s Degree in
    Educational Administration.</p>
<p>In her native Guatemala, she worked at an alternative school where she learned to embrace the Reggio Emilia
    philosophy.
    Her goal has always been to teach in a non-traditional educational setting, to reach children, not by content or
    objectives proposed by adults, but by respecting their own interests, their concerns, and above all, letting them be
    children. She says, "My best teachers have been the children. The day I run out of imagination, they will be my best
    guides."</p>
<p>Mahiba loves to teach at Nuestro Jardín, a place that shares her teaching philosophy.</p>

    Gilberto Rios graduated as elementary school teacher from Instituto Nacional Mixto Alejandro Cordova in his native Guatemala. He later obtained a Master’s degree from the University of San Carlos of Guatemala in Pedagogía y Ciencias en Educación. He both taught and was a school Principal at a primary school in Guatemala until 2000 when he decided to move to the United States.
</p>
<p>
    Gilberto loves working with children, enjoys singing, dancing, reading stories to them, and seeing how much learning occurs when children are playing. In these 28 years as an educator, he has learned that connecting with children and really listening to them is key to helping them learn. For Gilberto, reaching children in their formative years is very important to him, so that they grow up to be happy and well rounded individuals.
</p>
<p>
    Before joining Nuestro Jardin, Gilberto worked in the States at Chiquitos School for the Oregon Development Coalition (OCDC) and at The International School Portland. He is excited to teach at Nuestro Jardín and looks forward to getting to know the children and parents of his new community!

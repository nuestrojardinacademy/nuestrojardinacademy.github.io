    Claudia Urbina Basail, was born and raised in Mexico City. Since she was a little girl, Claudia always had an adventurous spirit, living in a city occupied with 20 million people. As a child, she helped her grandmother distribute her magazines to sponsors, making her grandmother one of the few female publishers in Mexico. She traveled all over the city alone, working hard to finish the job she was assigned.

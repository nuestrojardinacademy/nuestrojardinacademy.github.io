    Gilberto loves working with children, enjoys singing, dancing, reading stories to them, and seeing how much learning occurs when children are playing. In these 28 years as an educator, he has learned that connecting with children and really listening to them is key to helping them learn. For Gilberto, reaching children in their formative years is very important to him, so that they grow up to be happy and well rounded individuals.

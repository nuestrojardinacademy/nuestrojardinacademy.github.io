    Peggy Whipple was born in Lima-Peru. Since she was young, she felt a passion for other languages and decided to start learning English at a British School. Later on, she moved to London to keep studying English and to work as a private nanny teaching Spanish. It was there where she realized how much she enjoyed working with children and also discovered that she was a great cook. Peggy went back to Peru and took classes at a culinary school, and later on opened her own restaurant. In 2002, she received a job offer in California and she accepted.  She lived and worked in the Bay Area for 4 years and in summer of 2006, she fell in love with Oregon and moved to Portland.

    This year Peggy decided to take a break in the medical field and be involved, once again, with children education. She feels that working with the Reggio Emilia methodology, she will have the opportunity to share her culture and especially her language. She is happy to have the opportunity to work and be part of Nuestro Jardín Academy as a teacher’s assistant where she will be able to make children play, dance, and be involved in cooking projects.

    {% trans "Lisset is a resourceful, imaginative, fun, and passionate teaching professional. Her focal point of expertise is implementing a child-centered, interactive and communicative approach to the pedagogy of Spanish language acquisition. In her classes, children learn through all their senses using concrete objects. Words are not just heard, they are seen, touched, tasted, and smelled. Latin culture comes to life through music, storytelling and traditional games. With this approach the learning process becomes fun and engaging, thus making the language easier to assimilate. Her approach to teaching art is based on the idea that art is about exploration. She supports children in creating artwork that reflects their own interests, ideas, discoveries and inventions." %}
